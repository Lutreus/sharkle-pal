The install for this is available for windows and linux** in the installer section
    ** in progress


### windows release
download, install and execute just easy as that. 

### linux
Download the sharkle.appImage and place it somewhere safe. Then open it doing `./sharkle.appImage` after that it should just open.


If you enable auto-launch you shouldn't move the appImage file from place. 
The sharkle will appear in the tasks list (the one from alt + tab) -anyone who want to help with that also appreciated-

Notes from Collie: Linux download currently not existent for this version, sadly. I'll add one soon. This whole version is just fine tuning/tweaks of the original app by Ignacio! 

**install is currently in a rar because i made it too big. (>100 mb oopsy)... So ill fix that soon!

updates: better draggin, transparent parts sprites now clickable, more sounds, added eepy

current todo: Add strolling, Add speed up on middle click, maybe angy
